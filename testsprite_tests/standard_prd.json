It provides ingestion from Claude Code logs, AI-guided interview capture, hybrid search, and entity resolution backed by Neo4j and PostgreSQL.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Capture and persist decision traces (what, why, alternatives) from conversations and interviews",
    "Provide accurate entity resolution and a consistent knowledge graph for retrieval and reasoning",
    "Enable fast hybrid search (lexical + semantic) over decisions and entities",
    "Support AI-guided capture sessions to elicit tacit knowledge interactively",
    "Expose APIs for ingestion, analytics, project scoping, and export while maintaining per-user isolation"
